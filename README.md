# This webpage is an interactive demonstration of three distinct modules, each presented in the form of an animated card.

Each module is implemented as a "card" with two "surfaces". The first surface contains the module's name and icon and is clickable â€“ leading to the respective page or function. The second surface provides a detailed description of the module. When a user hovers over a card, it animates to flip, revealing the additional information.

The page's design is minimalist, employing dark tones and neon accents, which gives the interface a modern and stylish look. For added dynamics in the background, the Three.js library is used to create an interactive 3D backdrop. The page also features a digital clock and calendar, designed in a retro aesthetic using the "Share Tech Mono" font.

# Here's a detailed description of each modul: 

# Guess the Tiles
Is an interactive game designed to enhance memory. The game encourages users to flip tiles and find pairs with matching numbers. Every new game shuffles the tiles, making each round a unique memory challenge.

# Calendar + Weather
