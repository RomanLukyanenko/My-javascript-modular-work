# This webpage is an interactive demonstration of three distinct modules, each presented in the form of an animated card.

Each module is implemented as a "card" with two "surfaces". The first surface contains the module's name and icon and is clickable â€“ leading to the respective page or function. The second surface provides a detailed description of the module. When a user hovers over a card, it animates to flip, revealing the additional information.

The page's design is minimalist, employing dark tones and neon accents, which gives the interface a modern and stylish look. For added dynamics in the background, the Three.js library is used to create an interactive 3D backdrop. The page also features a digital clock and calendar, designed in a retro aesthetic using the "Share Tech Mono" font.
